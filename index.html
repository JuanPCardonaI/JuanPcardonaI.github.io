        <p>I am Juan Cardona, a bilingual up-and-coming sophomore student at Cambridge Rindge and Latin High School. I was born in Venezuela, and in 2015, my family and I moved to Cambridge to find a new life. When I first got to Cambridge, I didn't know a speck of English, and I didn't want to learn it. My parents put me in a bilingual school where each week it rotated from English to Spanish. My parents always tell people I came back from the English weeks tired and angry, and that when I came from the Spanish weeks, I seemed so much happier. As the months went by, despite my hate for the English language and the culture that came with it, I decided to give it a try. Two months went by and I had picked up a good amount of English, and I loved it. I started making friends, meeting people, finally interacting with this new world that I had to immerse myself in. It has now been 8 years, and I am now fully fluent in both Spanish and English, and I'm trying to pick up a third language. I joined E1T1 out of the blue; I was put into the program through the mayor's program, but I love it. I've always had a passion for technology, and now I can interact with it in more ways than I could imagine thanks to Each1teach1.</p>
